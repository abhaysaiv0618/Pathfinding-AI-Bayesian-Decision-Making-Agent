# Pathfinding-AI-Bayesian-Decision-Making-Agent
# Technologies: Python, Matplotlib
# Designed and developed an artificial intelligence agent that utilizes Bayesian Networks to localize its own position and that of a specified target, while traversing through an unknown environment
# Implemented a decision-making algorithm that dynamically updates a probability distribution to effectively decide between exploring the current environment or pursuing a target
